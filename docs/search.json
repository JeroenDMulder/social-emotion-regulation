    "text": "Behavioural responses\nAggressive behavioral responses to social rejection were measured during each fMRI session using the social network aggression task (SNAT). In short, during the SNAT, a participant would receive feedback from multiple peers on their own personal profile (which they created themselves specifically for the study). The feedback was either positive, neutral, or negative. Participants were told that they could press a button to send a loud noise blast to the peers in response to the feedback. The longer the button press, the longer, and louder, the noise blast would be. The length of the button press (in ms) was recorded, and taken as a proxy for behavioral aggressive response (maximum length of the button press was 3500 ms). In total, there were 20 neutral trials and 20 negative trials per fMRI session, resulting in three sets of 40 repeated behavioral responses for individuals who completed measurements at all three waves.\nSeveral characteristics of the behavioural response measurements warrant attention. First, the data have a hierarchical structure, with repeated feedback trials (level 1) nested in measurement waves (level 2), which are nested in individuals (level 3), which are nested in families (level 4). Second, there are individually-varying times of observation for the fMRI sessions (see the reported age range per measurement wave in Table 1 of the main paper). Hence, at any given wave, participants might have been at a different stage in their developmental process. Third, Figure 1 shows that a significant amount of behavioral response measurements have been censored from above, resulting from a time limit on the length of the button press.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Noise blast duration (seconds) per measurement occasion.\n\n\n\n\nFourth, there is a fair amount of missing data. For the behavioral response measurements, this exists almost entirely of dropout. The noise columns in Figure 2 display the different missing data patterns across time for these measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Missing data patterns. The behavioural measurements are denoted by noise. DLPFC, INS, and MPFC are the neural responses in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and medial prefrontal cortext, respectively."

    "text": "Neural responses\nIn addition to behavioral responses after social feedback, neural responses after social feedback were also measured using fMRI scans during the SNAT, specifically in the anterior insula AI, the medial prefrontal cortex MPFC, and the dorsolateral prefrontal corect DLPFC. Like the behavioral response measure, the neural responses also have a hierarchical structure. However, preprocessing of the fMRI data resulted in measurements that are contrasts between average brain response for neutral feedback versus average brain response for negative feedback. Hence, the neural measurements have a three level structure compared to the behavioral measurements (i.e., there is no neural data at the trial level, level 1). Furthermore, there is missing data in the neural measurements, as visualized in Figure 2. This is a combination of dropout and measurement error (e.g., when children move too much to get an accurate fMRI scan; Table 1 in the main paper contains an overview of reasons for exclusion frequencies of fMRI measurements per wave). Finally, as the behavioral and neural measurements were taken simultaneously, there are individually-varying times of observation to also need to be taken into account for these measurements.\nThe neural responses (i.e., contrast) across time are plotted in the spaghetti plots below. These plots are useful as an initial exploration of individual development in brain response. The thick black line represent the average linear development in brain response, and colored lines represent individual brain responses across time. From the plot it becomes clear that there are many differences in how individuals develop over time, and that on average development appears to be only minor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Observed neural responses across age."

    "section": "Bayesian multilevel growth curve model (Aim 1)",
    "text": "Bayesian multilevel growth curve model (Aim 1)\nThe growth curve models were build up as follows. Let \\(noise_{fiwt}\\) be the noise blast duration (in seconds) for an individual \\(i\\) from family \\(f\\), at measurement wave \\(w\\) and trial \\(t\\). At level 1, the model is given by \\[\nnoise_{fiwt} = \\beta_{0fiw} + \\beta_{1fiw} \\; x_{fiwt} + e_{fiwt}.\n\\] \\(x_{fiwt}\\) is the condition (type of feedback, with 0 = neutral, negative = 1), \\(\\beta_{0fiw}\\) is a random mean representing noise blast duration for neutral feedback for individual \\(i\\) from family \\(f\\) at wave \\(w\\), \\(\\beta_{1fiw}\\) is a random slope representing the difference between the neutral and negative condition for individual \\(i\\) from family \\(f\\) at wave \\(w\\), and \\(e_{fiwt}\\) represents the residual.\nAt level 2, the model is specified as \\[\\beta_{0fiw} = \\gamma_{00fi} + u_{0fiw},\\] \\[\\beta_{1fiw} = \\gamma_{10fi} + \\gamma_{11fi} \\; a_{fiw} + \\gamma_{12fi} \\; a_{fiw}^{2} + u_{1fiw},\\] where \\(\\gamma_{00fi}\\) is a random intercept representing noise blast for the neutral condition, and \\(u_{0fiw}\\) is the random effect with variance \\(Var[u_{0fiw}]\\), representing a family-, individual-, and wave-specific deviation from \\(\\gamma_{00fi}\\). To describe development in response over time, \\(\\beta_{1fiw}\\) is predicted from age \\(a_{fiw}\\), and age-squared \\(a^{2}_{fiw}\\). The predictor is grand-mean centered at 0 to prevent issues with multicollinearity, such that \\(a_{fiw} = 0\\) now represents an age of approximately 9 years and 9 months. The coefficients \\(\\gamma_{10fi}\\), \\(\\gamma_{11fi}\\), and \\(\\gamma_{12fi}\\) are the growth components of interest, describing the mean response, linear development in response, and quadratic development in response of individual \\(i\\) from family \\(f\\) at 9 years and 9 months of age, respectively. \\(u_{1fiw}\\) is a random component with variance \\(Var[u_{1fiw}]\\), representing a family-, individual-, and wave-specific deviations from the expected \\(\\beta_{1fiw}\\).\nAt level 3, the model is specified as \\[\\gamma_{00fi} = \\delta_{0} + v_{0fi},\\] \\[\\gamma_{10fi} = \\delta_{1f} + v_{1fi},\\] \\[\\gamma_{11fi} = \\delta_{2f} + v_{2fi},\\] \\[\\gamma_{12fi} = \\delta_{3f} + v_{3fi},\\] where \\(\\delta_{0f}\\) represents the mean noise blast of family \\(f\\) for the neutral condition, and \\(v_{0fi}\\) represents the individual-specific deviation from \\(\\delta_{00}\\) with variance \\(Var[v_{0fi}]\\). \\(\\delta_{1f}\\), \\(\\delta_{2f}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3f}\\) represent the family means of the growth components described on level 2, and \\(v_{1fi}\\), \\(v_{2fi}\\), and \\(v_{3fi}\\) represent individual-specific (i.e., within-family) deviations from these means with variances \\(Var[v_{1fi}]\\), \\(Var[v_{2fi}]\\), and \\(Var[v_{3fi}]\\).\nFinally, at level 4, the model is given by \\[\\delta_{0f} = \\theta_{0} + z_{0f},\\] \\[\\delta_{1f} = \\theta_{1} + z_{1f},\\] \\[\\delta_{2f} = \\theta_{2} + z_{2f},\\] \\[\\delta_{3f} = \\theta_{3} + z_{3f}.\\] where \\(\\theta_{0}\\) is the grand mean (across families, individuals, waves, and trials) of noise blast for the neutral condition. \\(\\theta_{1}\\), \\(\\theta_{2}\\), and \\(\\theta_{3}\\) are the grand means of the growth components. \\(z_{1f}\\), \\(z_{2f}\\), and \\(z_{3f}\\) are family-specific differences herein, with variances \\(Var[z_{1f}]\\), \\(Var[z_{2f}]\\), and \\(Var[z_{3f}]\\). In total, 15 parameters are estimated in this model, namely 4 fixed effects and 4 random effect variances at level 4, 4 random effect variances at level 3, 2 random effect variances at level 2, and 1 residual variance at level 1.\nMissing data were imputed as part of model fitting. Due to the setup of the study (with a planned two-year interval between subsequent measurement waves), missing values for age \\(a^{mis}_{fiw}\\) could be predicted from the individual’s age at the first measurement wave ageW1c and the wave number. Missing values for age-squared \\(a^{2, mis}_{fiw}\\) could then be created simply by squaring \\(a^{mis}_{fiw}\\). This resulted in the exclusion of a single family (two individuals) from the sample, who had missing values at their first measurement wave. For the outcome, missing values were predicted from feedback condition \\(X\\), age \\(A\\), and age-squared \\(A^{2}\\). For this procedure to work well, missing at random (MAR) has to be assumed, implying that the degree of missingness only depends on the observed data. While, the plausibility of this assumption can be questioned, it is a weaker assumption than missing completely at random (MCAR), which would be assumed when the missing values were simply deleted from the data (Gelman et al. 2013).\nFor the brain data, mean response is already available from the preprocessing of the MRI data. Therefore, in the model above, the trial level is removed, as well as the equation for \\(\\beta_{0fiw}\\) at level 2. The interpretation of the remaining parameters, and the procedure used to impute for missing values, are equivalent.\nR code for model fitting is printed below, for each outcome in a separate tab. brms allows for models to be specified using lme4-like syntax. The mi() wrapper around variables denotes that missing values are imputed. For each outcome, iter = 4000 values were sampled from the posterior distribution, of which the first warmup = 2000 were discarded. chains = 2 chains were used, and convergence was assessed using the split-\\(\\hat{R}\\) value (Gelman et al. 2013). Only every thin = 4\\(^{th}\\) simulation draw was kept to keep model size manageable, resulting in a total of 1000 posterior simulation draws. Stan’s default uninformative priors were used because no independent prior information was available on the development of behavioral and brain emotion regulation as measured using the SNAT.\n\nnoiseDLPFCAIMPFC\n\n\nNoise blast measurements have a lower limit of 0, and are restricted from above at 3500 ms. In theory, this information could be included in the model in the form of a bounded prior on the range of values that the fixed effects \\(\\theta\\) could take on. However, the brms manual states that such a procedure is rarely useful, and hence default uninformative priors were used. The cens() function was used to denote which values were censored. Two models where fitted. The first assumed that the outcome was Gaussian distributed. Second, given the complexity of this 4-level model, and the restricted range of noise, a model assuming a t-distributed outcome was fitted as well to allow for more robust inference (Gelman et al. 2013).\n\n# Gaussian response distribution\nf_noise_gaus &lt;- \n  bf(noise | cens(censored) + mi() ~ 1 + con + con:mi(agec) + con:mi(agec2) + \n       (1 + con | fam/id/wave) + (-1 + con:mi(agec) + con:mi(agec2) | fam/id)) + \n  gaussian() + \n  bf(agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0) +\n  bf(agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02)\n\nm_noise_gaus &lt;- brm(f_noise_gaus,\n  data = df_noise,\n  warmup = 2000,\n  iter = 4000,\n  chains = 2,\n  init = \"random\",\n  cores = 2,\n  thin = 4,\n  seed = 20221005,\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.85)\n)\n\n# Student-t response distribution\nf_noise_stud &lt;- \n  bf(noise | cens(censored) + mi() ~ 1 + con + con:mi(agec) + con:mi(agec2) + \n       (1 + con | fam/id/wave) + (-1 + con:mi(agec) + con:mi(agec2) | fam/id)) + \n  student() + \n  bf(agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0) +\n  bf(agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02)\n\nm_noise_stud &lt;- brm(f_noise_stud,\n  data = df_noise,\n  warmup = 2000,\n  iter = 4000,\n  chains = 2,\n  init = \"random\",\n  cores = 2,\n  thin = 4,\n  seed = 20221005,\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.88)\n)\n\n\n\n\nf_DLPFC_3L &lt;- \n  bf(DLPFC | mi() ~ 1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) + (1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) | fam/id)) + \n  gaussian() +\n  bf(agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0) +\n  bf(agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02)\n\nm_DLPFC_3L &lt;- brm(f_DLPFC_3L,\n  data = df_brain,\n  warmup = 2000,\n  iter = 4000,\n  chains = 2,\n  init = \"random\", \n  cores = 2,\n  thin = 4,\n  seed = 20221005\n)\n\n\n\nThe term AI in the R code below actually refers to the anterior insula AI.\n\nf_INS_3L &lt;- \n  bf(INS | mi() ~ 1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) + (1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) | fam/id)) + \n  gaussian() +\n  bf(agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0) +\n  bf(agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02)\n\nm_INS_3L &lt;- brm(f_INS_3L,\n  data = df_brain,\n  warmup = 2000,\n  iter = 4000,\n  chains = 2,\n  init = \"random\", \n  cores = 2,\n  thin = 4,\n  seed = 20221005\n)\n\n\n\n\nf_MPFC_3L &lt;- \n  bf(MPFC | mi() ~ 1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) + (1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) | fam/id)) + \n  gaussian() + \n  bf(agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0) +\n  bf(agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02)\n\nm_MPFC_3L &lt;- brm(f_MPFC_3L,\n  data = df_brain,\n  warmup = 2000,\n  iter = 4000,\n  chains = 2,\n  init = \"random\", \n  cores = 2,\n  thin = 4,\n  seed = 20221005\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviations from preregistration\nThe preregistration by Achterberg et al.

Therefore, these coefficients were excluded from the model."

    "text": "Structural equation model (Aims 2 and 3)\nThe analyses described here are related to both Aims 2 and 3. For Aim 2, associations between the growth components of the four behavioral and brain outcomes were investigated. For Aim 3, estimated individual-level growth components were used to predict social well-being at wave 6. In this section, I first discus how growth components for each individual are extracted from the growth curve models. Second, a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis model is introduced to investigate the dimensionality of the five social well-being subscales. Third, a structural equation model is introduced to estimate correlations between the growth components, and to predict social well-being during adolescence.\n\nCreating individual-level growth components\nThe results from the fitted Bayesian multilevel growth curve models are based on 1000 draws of the poster distribution for each parameter, which includes both fixed effects and random effects. Therefore, at each iteration, the sampled fixed effects and individually drawn random effects can be extracted from the model and used compute personalized growth components. Specifically, for an individual \\(i\\) from family \\(f\\), and given a specific iteration, the growth components are computed as \\[\\gamma_{10fi} = \\theta_{1} + z_{1f} + v_{1if},\\] \\[\\gamma_{11fi} = \\theta_{2} + z_{2f} + v_{2if},\\] \\[\\gamma_{12fi} = \\theta_{3} + z_{3f} + v_{3if}.\\] Computing these three parameters, for each of the four outcomes, and for each iteration, results in 1000 data sets of \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) personalized growth components. These serve as input for predicting social well-being. R code for these computations is too long to display here, but is available at GitHub.\n\n\nDimensionality of social well-being\nSocial well-being data consists of 35 items, belonging to one of five subscales. The data were preprocessed by computing factor scores for each subscale by taking the mean of the respective items (as instructed in the subscale manuals). Using the R package lavaan (version 0.6.12), a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis model was fitted with the subscales scores as indicators (Rosseel 2012).\n\n# Confirmatory factor analysis social well-being using lavaan.\nm_cfa_well &lt;- '\n  # 1-factor model for social well-being\n  well =~ 1*co + who + sc + cf + gs\n'\n\n\n\nMultivariate regression/prediction model\nStructural equation modeling was used to estimate the relations between the development behavioral and brain responses, as well as later social well-being. A multiple regression model was specified with the social well-being subscales as the outcome, and the growth components for each outcome as predictors. The predictors are allowed to covary freely with each other to investigate the associations between development in response of behavioral and brain outcomes. The estimated regression coefficients then represent the relationship between development in social emotion regulation and social well-being in adolescence. lavaan model syntax can be found below.\n\nm_regression &lt;- '\n  # Regression\n  co ~ gamma10_INS + gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  who ~ gamma10_INS + gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  sc ~ gamma10_INS + gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  cf ~ gamma10_INS + gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  gs ~ gamma10_INS + gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  \n  # Variances \n  gamma10_INS ~~ gamma10_INS\n  gamma11_INS ~~ gamma11_INS\n  gamma12_INS ~~ gamma12_INS\n  \n  gamma10_DLPFC ~~ gamma10_DLPFC\n  gamma11_DLPFC ~~ gamma11_DLPFC\n  gamma12_DLPFC ~~ gamma12_DLPFC\n  \n  gamma10_MPFC ~~ gamma10_MPFC\n  gamma11_MPFC ~~ gamma11_MPFC\n  gamma12_MPFC ~~ gamma12_MPFC\n  \n  gamma10_noise ~~ gamma10_noise\n  gamma11_noise ~~ gamma11_noise\n  gamma12_noise ~~ gamma12_noise\n  \n  # Residual variances\n  co ~~ co \n  who ~~ who \n  sc ~~ sc\n  cf ~~ cf\n  gs ~~ gs\n  \n  # Covariances\n  gamma10_INS ~~ gamma11_INS + gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise \n  gamma11_INS ~~ gamma12_INS + gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise \n  gamma12_INS ~~ gamma10_DLPFC + gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise \n  \n  gamma10_DLPFC ~~ gamma11_DLPFC + gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise \n  gamma11_DLPFC ~~ gamma12_DLPFC + gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  gamma12_DLPFC ~~ gamma10_MPFC + gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  \n  gamma10_MPFC ~~ gamma11_MPFC + gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise \n  gamma11_MPFC ~~ gamma12_MPFC + gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  gamma12_MPFC ~~ gamma10_noise + gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  \n  gamma10_noise ~~ gamma11_noise + gamma12_noise\n  gamma11_noise ~~ gamma12_noise\n  \n  # Residual covariances\n  co ~~ who + sc + cf + gs\n  who ~~ sc + cf + gs\n  sc ~~ cf + gs\n  cf ~~ gs\n' \n\nTo take the uncertainty of the individual growth component estimates from the Bayesian multilevel growth curve models into account, the SEM model was fitted to each of the 1000 data sets using the R package semTools (Jorgensen, Pornprasertmanit, and Schoemann 2022).

    "text": "Development of behavioral and brain responses (Aim 1)\nIn this section, model fit is evaluated using a posterior predictive check, and the results are presented. The results are organized below per outcome separately.\n\nnoiseDLPFCAIMPFC\n\n\nThe posterior predictive checks (ppc) of two models for noise are shown in Figure 4: The left panel is a ppc-plot from a model assuming a Gaussian-distributed outcome; the right panel is a ppc-plot from a model assuming a Student t-distributed outcome. The comparison shows that using a t-distribution, the model is better able to capture the kurtosis in the observed density, and that the modes of the posterior draws better align with the peak of the observed data. Therefore, the model assuming a t-distributed outcome is selected for further interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Posterior predictive checks (ppc) for the behavioural (aggresive) response (noise). The model underlying the left plot assumes a normally-distributed outcome; the model underlying the right plot assumes a Student t-distributed outcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe right panel of Figure 4 shows that the model predicts numerous values higher than 3.5. To assess how well the proportion of predicted values higher than 3.5 represents the proportion of observed censored values, a third posterior predictive check was performed. Figure 5 shows that the model underestimates the proportion of noise blasts longer 3.5 seconds. However, in absolute sense, this misfit is small enough to move forward with this model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Posterior predictive checks (ppc) for the proportion right censored outcomes for behavioural (aggresive) response. A Student t-distributed outcome was assumed.\n\n\n\n\nResults for the noise model (with Student t-distributed response) are shown below. The fixed effects estimated \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{1}\\), \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{2}\\), and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{3}\\) can be found under Population-Level Effects as noise_con, noise_con:miagec, and noise_con:miagec2, respectively. Standard deviation estimates of random effects at the family-level (i.e., \\(z\\) parameters) are reported under ~fam, standard deviation estimations of random effects at the individual-level (i.e., \\(v\\) parameters) are reported under ~fam:id, and standard deviation estimates of random effecst at the wave-level (i.e., \\(u\\) parameters) are reported under fam:id:wave.\n\n\nWarning: Parts of the model have not converged (some Rhats are &gt; 1.05).

Moreover, the bulk effective sample size Bulk_ESS for this parameter, as well as for the random between-family effect of the mean noise response \\(SD(z_{1})\\), is (far) below the recommended number of effective samples (100 times the number of chains). This speaks to the complexity of the model, especially in relation to the relatively low sample sizes at the family- and individual-level.\nThe fixed effects show that there is 95% certainty that expected response in noise at 9 years and 9 months of age \\(\\theta_{1}\\) lies between \\(1.31\\) and \\(1.49\\) seconds. The random effects imply that there are significant differences between individuals (within families) herein, \\(SD(v_{1}) = [0.03 - 0.42]\\), as well as significant between-family differences, \\(SD(z_{1}) = [0.15 - 0.43]\\). Linear development of noise at mean age \\(\\theta_{2}\\) lies between \\(-0.05\\) and \\(0.02\\). The random effect estimates suggests slight between family differences herein, \\(SD(z_{2}) = [0.01 - 0.16]\\). The quadratic development of noise at mean age \\(\\theta_{3}\\) is estimated to lie between \\(-0.06\\) and \\(-0.03\\), and no significant differences between individuals, \\(SD(v_{3}) = [0.00 - 0.03]\\), or between families, \\(SD(z_{3}) = [0.00 - 0.05]\\), have been found.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Model predicted development in behavioral response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults for the DLPFC model are shown below.\n\n\n Family: MV(gaussian, gaussian, gaussian) \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity\n         mu = identity; sigma = identity\n         mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: DLPFC | mi() ~ 1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) + (1 + mi(agec) + mi(agec2) | fam/id) \n         agec | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c + wave0 \n         agec2 | mi() ~ -1 + ageW1c2 + ageW1c_wave0 + wave02 \n   Data: df_brain (Number of observations: 1536) \n  Draws: 2 chains, each with iter = 4000; warmup = 2000; thin = 4;\n         total post-warmup draws = 1000\n\nGroup-Level Effects: \n~fam (Number of levels: 256) \n                                   Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat\nsd(DLPFC_Intercept)                    0.31      0.23     0.01     0.84 1.00\nsd(DLPFC_miagec)                       0.18      0.12     0.01     0.43 1.00\nsd(DLPFC_miagec2)                      0.06      0.05     0.00     0.16 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec)     -0.08      0.50    -0.89     0.86 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec2)    -0.23      0.50    -0.94     0.79 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_miagec,DLPFC_miagec2)        0.01      0.50    -0.86     0.90 1.00\n                                   Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsd(DLPFC_Intercept)                     519      749\nsd(DLPFC_miagec)                        475      746\nsd(DLPFC_miagec2)                       424      683\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec)       687      775\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec2)      550      768\ncor(DLPFC_miagec,DLPFC_miagec2)         741      900\n\n~fam:id (Number of levels: 512) \n                                   Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat\nsd(DLPFC_Intercept)                    0.38      0.26     0.02     0.97 1.00\nsd(DLPFC_miagec)                       0.25      0.14     0.02     0.53 1.02\nsd(DLPFC_miagec2)                      0.06      0.04     0.00     0.17 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec)     -0.15      0.46    -0.90     0.78 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec2)    -0.13      0.49    -0.89     0.83 1.00\ncor(DLPFC_miagec,DLPFC_miagec2)        0.02      0.48    -0.83     0.86 1.01\n                                   Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsd(DLPFC_Intercept)                     395      605\nsd(DLPFC_miagec)                        196      540\nsd(DLPFC_miagec2)                       404      562\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec)       477      799\ncor(DLPFC_Intercept,DLPFC_miagec2)      717      749\ncor(DLPFC_miagec,DLPFC_miagec2)         507      841\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n                   Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nDLPFC_Intercept       -0.38      0.15    -0.65    -0.09 1.00      770      908\nagec_ageW1c            1.02      0.00     1.02     1.03 1.00      978      960\nagec_wave0             2.22      0.01     2.21     2.23 1.01     1010      991\nagec2_ageW1c2          1.00      0.01     0.99     1.02 1.00     1030      960\nagec2_ageW1c_wave0     4.49      0.03     4.43     4.55 1.00     1053      922\nagec2_wave02           5.04      0.03     4.98     5.10 1.00     1079     1028\nDLPFC_miagec          -0.01      0.06    -0.14     0.11 1.00      889      876\nDLPFC_miagec2          0.05      0.03    -0.02     0.11 1.00      894     1025\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n            Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma_DLPFC     3.23      0.09     3.04     3.41 1.00      482      723\nsigma_agec      0.18      0.00     0.17     0.18 1.01      955      939\nsigma_agec2     0.87      0.02     0.84     0.91 1.00      932      822\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).
