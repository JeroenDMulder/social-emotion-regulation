Studies in adults highlighted the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in regulating aggression. Little is known about the development of aggression regulation following social feedback during childhood, while this is an important period for both brain maturation and social relations. The current study used a longitudinal design, with 456 twins undergoing two functional MRI sessions across the transition from middle (7 to 9 y) to late (9 to 11 y) childhood. Aggression regulation was studied using the Social Network Aggression Task. Behavioral aggression after social evaluation decreased over time, whereas activation in the insula, dorsomedial PFC and DLPFC increased over time. Brain–behavior analyses showed that increased DLPFC activation after negative feedback was associated with decreased aggression. Change analyses further revealed that children with larger increases in DLPFC activity from middle to late childhood showed stronger decreases in aggression over time. These findings provide insights into the development of social evaluation sensitivity and aggression control in childhood.},

These distinctions are reflected in the neural structures that underlie social cognition, where there is a recent wealth of data primarily from functional neuroimaging.

            Social belonging is an important human drive that influences mood and behavior. Neural responses to social exclusion are well-characterized, but the specificity of these responses to processing rejection-related affective distress is unknown. The present study compares neural responses to exclusion and over-inclusion, a condition that similarly violates fairness expectations but does not involve rejection, with a focus on implications for models of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) function. In an fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball paradigm with adolescents 11.1-17.7 years of age (N=69), we employed parametric modulators to examine scaling of neural signal with cumulative exclusion and inclusion events, an approach that overcomes arbitrary definitions of condition onsets/offsets imposed on fluid, continuous gameplay. We identified positive scaling of dACC and posterior insula response with cumulative exclusion events, but these same regions exhibited trending signal
            decreases
            with cumulative inclusion events. Furthermore, areas within the dACC and insula also responded to context incongruency (throws to the participant in the exclusion run; throws between computer players in the over-inclusion run). Taken together, these findings caution against interpretations that responses in these regions uniquely reflect aspects of affective distress within social rejection paradigms. We further identified that the left ventrolateral PFC, rostromedial PFC, and left intraparietal sulcus responded similarly to cumulative exclusion and inclusion. These findings shed light on which neural regions exhibit patterns of differential sensitivity to exclusion or over-inclusion, as well as those that are more broadly engaged by both types of social interaction.},

              Social interaction inherently involves the subjective evaluation of cues salient to social inclusion and exclusion. Testifying to the importance of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index
              any
              socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of
              both
              inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of exclusion require significant revision.},

            This study investigated behavioral and neural correlates underlying social feedback processing and subsequent aggressive behaviors in childhood in two age cohorts (test sample: n = 509/n = 385 and replication sample: n = 354/n = 195, 7–9 years old). Using a previously validated Social Network Aggression Task, we showed that negative social feedback resulted in most behavioral aggression, followed by less aggression after neutral and least aggression after positive feedback. Receiving positive and negative social feedback was associated with increased activity in the insula, medial prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Responding to feedback was associated with additional activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) following positive feedback. This DLPFC activation correlated negatively with aggression. Furthermore, age analyses showed that older children showed larger reductions in aggression following positive feedback and more neural activation in the DLPFC when responding to positive feedback compared to younger children. To assess the robustness of our results, we examined these processes in two independent behavioral/functional magnetic resonance imaging samples using equivalence testing, thereby contributing to replicable reports. Together, these findings demonstrate an important role of social saliency and regulatory processes where regulation of aggression rapidly develops between the ages of 7 and 9 years.},

            The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

In the present multi-sample mixed method study we developed a novel assessment tool of adolescent wellbeing, the Adolescent Wellbeing Paradigm (AWP). In Study 1, an online survey study among Dutch-speaking adolescents and young adults (N = 339, Mage = 18.44 years, SD = 3.53, 79\% females) was conducted to inspect which initial AWP-items were viewed as being important for their wellbeing. In Study 2, we co-evaluated the original AWP-items and co-created new items with adolescents and young adults (N = 25) via focus groups. In Study 3, we examined the validity and reliability of the updated AWP in a new sample of youth (Mage = 19.86 years, SD = 4.46, 71\% females). Principal Components Analyses revealed five factors of adolescent wellbeing: 1) having impact, purpose, and meaning; 2) absence of (excessive) stress; 3) family relationships; 4) self-confidence; and 5) feeling respected, appreciated, and loved. These AWP-factors were related to other measures of mental health and wellbeing, and the AWP showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. In conclusion, the AWP was found to be a valid and reliable measure of adolescent wellbeing.},

Extant research suggests that a network of brain regions that support the affective but not the sensory components of physical pain underlie both experiences. Here we demonstrate that when rejection is powerfully elicited—by having people who recently experienced an unwanted break-up view a photograph of their ex-partner as they think about being rejected—areas that support the sensory components of physical pain (secondary somatosensory cortex; dorsal posterior insula) become active. We demonstrate the overlap between social rejection and physical pain in these areas by comparing both conditions in the same individuals using functional MRI. We further demonstrate the specificity of the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activity to physical pain by comparing activated locations in our study with a database of over 500 published studies. Activation in these regions was highly diagnostic of physical pain, with positive predictive values up to 88\%. These results give new meaning to the idea that rejection “hurts.” They demonstrate that rejection and physical pain are similar not only in that they are both distressing—they share a common somatosensory representation as well.},

              Our review examines the current state of the research on hot executive function (EF), as contrasted with cool EF, with regard to the evidence for construct validity. Current theoretical discussions have examined the conceptual overlap among constructs such as hot EF, effortful control, self-control, and self-regulation. We explore this emerging literature with a focus on research questions, tasks, and methods. Finally, we consider the unresolved questions facing the study of hot EF, most notably the difficulty in determining the relative “heat” of a given task based on task content, testing context, and the individual differences among the participants.

	abstract = {During the transition from childhood to emerging adolescence (approximately between the ages of 7-14-years-old) peer relations become more salient. Social emotion regulation, i.e., regulating emotions in social situations, for example after receiving (negative) peer feedback, is an important prerequisite for developing and maintaining peer relations. A broad range of literature has shown that receiving negative social feedback can result in reactive aggression. Recent studies additionally have shown that regulating such aggression is related to neural activation, and both behavioral and neural responses to social emotion regulation develop across childhood and adolescence. However, existing research has focused largely on group-based averages, obscuring meaningful individual variation in development. This ‘aggregate approach’ needlessly eliminates rich information in the form of within-participant variability. To move toward a more nuanced understanding of neurocognitive changes, developmental neuroimaging studies need to characterize individual differences as a variable of interest. Therefore, the current study will specifically examine individual differences in developmental trajectories of social emotion regulation. Moreover, to understand the underlying brain mechanisms, we will examine how developmental trajectories of aggression regulation following negative social feedback relate to functional brain development. To address individual variations of developmental trajectories, we will use multi-level models using longitudinal data across three waves during childhood and emerging adolescence.},

	abstract = {Background
              Adolescence is a key time period for the emergence of psychosocial and mental health difficulties. To promote adolescent adaptive (‘resilient’) psychosocial functioning (PSF), appropriate conceptualisation and quantification of such functioning and its predictors is a crucial first step. Here, we quantify resilient functioning as the degree to which an individual functions better or worse than expected given their self-reported childhood family experiences, and relate this to adolescent family and friendship support.
            
            
              Method
              
                We used Principal Component and regression analyses to investigate the relationship between childhood family experiences and PSF (psychiatric symptomatology, personality traits and mental wellbeing) in healthy adolescents (the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network;
                N
                = 2389; ages 14–24). Residuals from the relation between childhood family experiences and PSF reflect resilient functioning; the degree to which an individual is functioning better, or worse, than expected given their childhood family experiences. Next, we relate family and friendship support with resilient functioning both cross-sectionally and 1 year later.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Friendship and family support were positive predictors of immediate resilient PSF, with friendship support being the strongest predictor. However, whereas friendship support was a significant positive predictor of
                later
                resilient functioning,
                family
                support had a
                negative
                relationship with later resilient PSF.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We show that friendship support, but not family support, is an important positive predictor of both immediate and later resilient PSF in adolescence and early adulthood. Interventions that promote the skills needed to acquire and sustain adolescent friendships may be crucial in increasing adolescent resilient PSF.},

Both types of variance are of key interest to psychology: Stable differences between persons are the main interest in psychological research on, for example, traits and risk factors. Variation in variables over time are the main interest in studies that focus on psychological processes, change, and development.  Failing to distinguishing between these sources of variance in our data can quickly result in wrong conclusions about both types of variation. This is an essential problem for all studies with data from multiple persons – cross-sectional and longitudinal. However, for many psychologists the problem with failing to distinguish within- and between-person variance remains obscure. My aim is to provide an entry-level review of the problem: To elucidate related jargon, the potential consequences of the problem, and various practical solutions to it. To illustrate the problem, I provide an online app in which researchers can change various settings to see how they influence the conclusions of analyses.},

              Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions
              1–3
              (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping
              4
              (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations
              5,6
              . Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},
