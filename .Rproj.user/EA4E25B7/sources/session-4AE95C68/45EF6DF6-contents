This document contains the online supplementary materials to Mulder, Dobbelaar, and Achterberg (under review). It serves as a methodological and statistical rationale, and highlights the R code that was used to fit the models and explore the results. It is organized as follows: First, the study design is summarized, and important characteristics of the data are highlighted. Second, statistical models are introduced in detail. Third, convergence and model fit is assessed. Finally, the results, which are organized according to the three aims of the project, are interpreted and visualized. The complete R code (i.e., including code that was used for data manipulation and the creation of visualizations) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/JeroenDMulder/social-emotion-regulation). 

## Study design and data
In this section, the study design and data characteristics are summarized. The focus is on those aspects that are relevant for the statistical analyses described later. Further details about the sample can be found in the study's preregistration by @achterberg_individual_2022 and in @dobbelaar_development_2022. Participants in this study took part in the longitudinal twin study of the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID). They were invited to participate in MRI sessions at three measurement occasions with approximately 2-year intervals, termed wave 1, 3, and 5, respectively. At each measurement occasion, the social network aggression task (SNAT) was used to measure a total of 4 kinds of responses to social rejection, namely: 

::: column-margin
The reader is referred to @crone_neural_2020 for details on the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development. Details about the SNAT, and the preparation of fMRI data can be found in the main paper.
:::

- behavioral (aggression) response, operationalized as noise blast durations (in ms) aimed at aggressors (`noise`),
- stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefortonal cortex (`DLPFC`),
- stimulation of the anterior insula (`AI`), and
- stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex (`MPFC`).

These outcomes were measured repeatedly after neutral and negative social feedback. In total, there were 20 neutral trials and 20 negative trials per measurement occasion, resulting in 3 sets of 40 repeated measures for individuals who completed measurements at all three waves. The behavioral measure `noise` is the length of a button press, that the participants imagined would result in a loud noise blast for perceived aggressors. The brain measures `DLPFC`, `AI`, and `MPFC` were obtained from fMRI scans. At wave 6, a social well-being questionnaire was filled in, consisting of 5 subscales: ten items from the Adolescent Wellbeing Paradigm (AWP), ten items from the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQoL), and three subscales (each five items) from the Harterâ€™s Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (SPPA), specifically the subscales Social Competence (SC), Close Friendships (CF) and Global Self-worth (GS). All items were answered on a four-point Likert scale, with low scores indicating low social well-being and high scores indicating high social well-being.

## Methods
Discussion of the data and statistical analyses below is structured according to the three research Aims:

1. To describe developmental trajectories of behavioral and brain responses to negative social feedback throughout childhood and emerging adolescence.
2. To estimate the associations between development in behavioral (aggressive) regulation and development in neural responses to social rejection.
3. To estimate the relationship between development in social emotion regulation and social well-being in adolescence.

### Aim 1: Development of behavioral and brain reactivity
In this section, important characteristics of the `noise`, `DLPFC`, `INS`, and `MPFC` data are discussed first. Second, a Bayesian multilevel growth curve model is introduced. 

#### Data
Several characteristics of the data warrant attention. First, the data have **a hierarchical structure**, with repeated behavioral and brain *trials* (level 1) nested in measurement *waves* (level 2), which are nested in *individuals* (level 3), which are nested in *families* (level 4). The behavioral measurements `noise` have data at all 4 levels. For the brain measures `DLPFC`, `AI`, and `MPFC`, preprocessing of the fMRI data already resulted in the contrasts between mean brain response for neutral feedback, and mean brain response for negative feedback. Therefore, neural responses to social rejection (compared to the neutral condition) do not have to be estimated anymore at the trial level. Second, there are **individually-varying times of observation** for the outcomes (see the reported age range per measurement wave in Table 1 of the paper). Hence, at each wave, participants might have been at a different stage in their development process. Third, Figure @fig-cens shows that the `noise` measurements have been censored from above, resulting from a time limit on the length of the button press (maximum of 3500 ms).

Fourth, there is a fair amount of **missing data**. This is a combination of dropout and measurement error (e.g., when children move too much to get an accurate fMRI scan). Figure @fig-missing shows the different missing data patterns.

Finally, Figure @fig-spaghetti visualizes the neural response to social rejection for each participant across time, which can be useful as an initial exploration of individual development in neural social emotion regulation across time. The thick black line represent the average linear development in neural response, and colored lines represent individual brain reactivity across time. From the plot it becomes clear that there are many differences in how individuals develop over time, and that *on average* development appears to be only minor.

#### Analyses
A Bayesian multilevel growth curve model was estimated for each outcome separately using the R-package `brms` [@Burkner2017] in R version ... [@RCoreTeam2022], and the statistical computation program Stan [@stan2022]. The Bayesian estimation framework was chosen because it can easily accommodate censoring by integrating out censored values [@Gelman2013]. Moreover, missing data can be imputed as part of the model fitting process under the assumption of missing at random (MAR) [@Burkner2017]. The multilevel framework was chosen because it treats the time of observation as data (rather than as a parameter, as in a latent growth curve model), and can therefore more easily handle individually-varying times of observations [@Mehta2000]. 

Let $noise_{fiwt}$ be the noise blast duration (in seconds) for an individual $i$ from family $f$, at measurement wave $w$ and trial $t$. At level 1, the model is given by
$$
noise_{fiwt} = \beta_{0fiw} + \beta_{1fiw} \; x_{fiwt} + e_{fiwt}. 
$$
$x_{fiwt}$ is the condition (type of feedback, with 0 = neutral, negative = 1), $\beta_{0fiw}$ is a random mean representing noise blast duration for neutral feedback for individual $i$ from family $f$ at wave $w$, $\beta_{1fiw}$ is a random slope representing the difference, or *reactivity*, between the neutral and negative condition for individual $i$ from family $f$ at wave $w$, and $e_{fiwt}$ represents the residuals. 

At level 2, the model is specified as
$$
\beta_{0fiw} = \gamma_{00fi} + u_{0fiw},\\
\beta_{1fiw} = \gamma_{10fi} + \gamma_{11fi} \; a_{fiw} + \gamma_{12fi} \; a_{fiw}^{2} + u_{1fiw},
$$
where $\gamma_{00fi}$ is a random intercept representing noise blast for the neutral condition, and $u_{0fiw}$ is the random component with variance $Var[u_{0fiw}]$, representing a family-, individual-, and wave-specific deviation from $\gamma_{00fi}$. To describe development in reactivity over time, $\beta_{1fiw}$ is predicted from age $a_{fiw}$, and age-squared $a^{2}_{fiw}$. The predictor is grand-mean centered at 0 to prevent issues with multicollinearity, such that $a_{fiw} = 0$ now represents an age of approximately 9 years and 9 months. The coefficients $\gamma_{10fi}$, $\gamma_{11fi}$, and $\gamma_{12fi}$ are the growth components of interest, describing the mean reactivity, linear development in reactivity, and quadratic development in reactivity of individual $i$ from family $f$ at 9 years and 9 months of age, respectively. $u_{1fiw}$ is a random component with variance $Var[u_{1fiw}]$, representing a family-, individual-, and wave-specific deviations from the expected $\beta_{1fiw}$.

At level 3, the model is specified as 
$$
\gamma_{00fi} = \delta_{0} + v_{0fi},\\
\gamma_{10fi} = \delta_{1f} + v_{1fi},\\
\gamma_{11fi} = \delta_{2f} + v_{2fi},\\
\gamma_{12fi} = \delta_{3f} + v_{3fi},
$$
where $\delta_{0f}$ represents the mean noise blast of family $f$ for the neutral condition, and $v_{0fi}$ represents the individual-specific deviation from $\delta_{00}$ with variance $Var[v_{0fi}]$. $\delta_{1f}$, $\delta_{2f}$, and $\delta_{3f}$ represent the family means of the growth components described on level 2, and $v_{1fi}$, $v_{2fi}$, and $v_{3fi}$ represent individual-specific (also referred to as within-family) deviations from these means with variances $Var[v_{1fi}]$, $Var[v_{2fi}]$, and $Var[v_{3fi}]$. 

Finally, at level 4, the model is given by
$$
\delta_{0f} = \theta_{0} + z_{0f},\\
\delta_{1f} = \theta_{1} + z_{1f},\\
\delta_{2f} = \theta_{2} + z_{2f},\\
\delta_{3f} = \theta_{3} + z_{3f}.
$$
where $\theta_{0}$ is the grand mean (across families, individuals, waves, and trials) of noise blast for the neutral condition. $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$, and $\theta_{3}$ are the grand means of the growth components. $z_{1f}$, $z_{2f}$, and $z_{3f}$ are family-specific differences herein, with variances $Var[z_{1f}]$, $Var[z_{2f}]$, and $Var[z_{3f}]$. In total, 15 parameters are estimated, namely 4 fixed effects and 4 random effect variances at level 4, 4 random effect variances at level 3, 2 random effect variances at level 2, and 1 residual variance at level 1. 

Missing data were imputed as part of model fitting. Due to the setup of the study (with a planned 2 year interval between subsequent measurement waves), missing values for age $a^{mis}_{fiw}$ could be predicted from the individual's age at the first measurement wave `ageW1c` and the wave number. Missing values for age-squared $a^{2, mis}_{fiw}$ could then be created simply by squaring $a^{mis}_{fiw}$. This resulted in the exclusion of a single family (2 individuals) from the sample, who had missing values at their first measurement wave. For the outcome, missing values were predicted from feedback condition $X$, age $A$, and age-squared $A^{2}$. For this procedure to work well, missing at random (MAR) has to be assumed, implying that the degree of missingness only depends on the observed data. While, the plausibility of this assumption can be questioned, it is a weaker assumption than missing completely at random (MCAR), which would be assumed when the missing values were simply deleted from the data [@Gelman2013]. 

For the brain data, mean reactivity is already available from the preprocessing of the MRI data. Therefore, in the model above, the trial level is removed, as well as the equation for $\beta_{0fiw}$ at level 2. The interpretation of the remaining parameters, and the procedure used to impute for missing values, are equivalent. 

R-code for model fitting is printed below, for each outcome in a separate tab. `brms` allows for models to be specified using `lme4`-like syntax. The `mi()` wrapper around variables denotes that missing values are imputed. For each outcome, `iter = 4000` values were sampled from the posterior distribution, of which the first `warmup = 2000` were discarded. `chains = 2` chains were used, and convergence was assessed using the split-$\hat{R}$ value [@Gelman2013]. Only every `thin = 4`$^{th}$ simulation draw was kept to keep model size manageable, resulting in a total of 1000 posterior simulation draws. `Stan`'s default uninformative priors were used because no independent prior information was available on the development of behavioral and brain emotion regulation as measured using the SNAT. 







This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte's styles in RMarkdown documents [@xie2018]. The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto[^1] supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.

1.  Increases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).
2.  Places footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.

These layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:

1.  To produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;
2.  To provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you'd like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option `fig-column: margin` for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you[^2].

[^2]: You never need to think about `\begin{marginfigure}` or `<span class="marginfigure">`; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.

If you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues>.

# Figures

## Margin Figures

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures in the margin you can use the **Quarto** chunk option `column: margin`. For example:


Note the use of the `fig-cap` chunk option to provide a figure caption. You can adjust the proportions of figures using the `fig-width` and `fig-height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.

## Arbitrary Margin Content

You can include anything in the margin by places the class `.column-margin` on the element. See an example on the right about the first fundamental theorem of calculus.

::: column-margin
We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
:::

## Full Width Figures

You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using the chunk option `fig-column: page-right`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-fullwidth
#| fig-cap: "A full width figure."
#| fig-width: 11
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-column: page-right
#| warning: false
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```

Other chunk options related to figures can still be used, such as `fig-width`, `fig-cap`, and so on. For full width figures, usually `fig-width` is large and `fig-height` is small. In the above example, the plot size is $11 \times 3$.

## Arbitrary Full Width Content

Any content can span to the full width of the page, simply place the element in a `div` and add the class `column-page-right`. For example, the following code will display its contents as full width.

``` md
::: {.fullwidth}
Any _full width_ content here.
:::
```

Below is an example:

::: column-page-right

:::

## Main Column Figures

Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column. This is the default type of figures in the LaTeX/HTML output.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-main
#| fig-cap: "A figure in the main column."
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Margin Captions

When you include a figure constrained to the main column, you can choose to place the figure's caption in the margin by using the `cap-location` chunk option. For example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-main-margin-cap
#| fig-cap: "A figure with a longer caption. The figure appears in the main column, but the caption is placed in the margin. Captions can even contain elements like a citation such as @xie2018."
#| cap-location: margin
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) + geom_boxplot()
```

# Sidenotes

One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the extensive use of sidenotes. There is a wide margin to provide ample room for sidenotes and small figures. Any use of a footnote will automatically be converted to a sidenote.

[This is a span that has the class `column-margin` which places it in the margin without the sidenote mark.]{.column-margin} If you'd like to place ancillary information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript number), you can use apply the `column-margin` class to the element.

# References

References can be displayed as margin notes for HTML output. For example, we can cite R here [@R-base].

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This feature depends upon `link-citations` to locate and place references in the margin. This is enabled by default, but if you disable `link-citations` then references in the HTML output will be placed at the end of the output document as they normally are.
:::

# Tables

You can use the `kable()` function from the **knitr** package to format tables that integrate well with the rest of the Tufte handout style. The table captions are placed in the margin like figures in the HTML output.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:6, 1:6], caption = 'A subset of mtcars.'
)
```

# Responsiveness

The HTML page layout is responsive- as the page width shrinks, elements will automatically adjust their position. Elements that appear in the margins will move inline with the content and elements that span the body and margin will automatically span only the body.

# More Examples

The rest of this document consists of a few test cases to make sure everything still works well in slightly more complicated scenarios. First we generate two plots in one figure environment with the chunk option `fig-show: hold`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-two-together
#| fig-cap: "Two plots in one figure environment."
#| fig-show: hold
#| warning: false
#| cap-location: margin
p <- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point()
p
p + geom_smooth()
```

Then two plots in separate figure environments (the code is identical to the previous code chunk, but the chunk option is the default `fig-show: asis` now):

```{r eval = FALSE, fig-two-separate, ref.label='fig-two-together', fig.cap=sprintf("Two plots in separate figure environments (the %s plot).", c("first", "second")), message=FALSE}
#| cap-location: margin
```

You may have noticed that the two figures have different captions, and that is because we used a character vector of length 2 for the chunk option `fig.cap` (something like `fig.cap = c('first plot', 'second plot')`).

::: {.callout-tip}
## Using R within Chunk Options
If you wish to use raw R expressions as part of the chunk options (like above), then you need to define those in the `tag=value` format within the curly brackets `{r label, tag=value}` instead of the `tag: value` YAML syntax on a new line starting with the hashpipe `#|`. The former approach is documented on [knitr's website](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) while the latter is explained in [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html).
:::

Next we show multiple plots in margin figures. Similarly, two plots in the same figure environment in the margin:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-margin-together
#| fig-cap: "Two plots in one figure environment in the margin."
#| fig-width: 3.5
#| fig-height: 2
#| fig-show: hold
#| column: margin
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
p
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Then two plots from the same code chunk placed in different figure environments:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(iris[,c(1,2,3,4)], 13))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| label: fig-margin-separate-a
#| fig-cap: "Two plots in separate figure environments in the margin"
#| fig-width: 3.5
#| fig-height: 2
#| column: margin
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
p
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(iris[,c(1,2,3,4)], 11))
```

We blended some tables in the above code chunk only as *placeholders* to make sure there is enough vertical space among the margin figures, otherwise they will be stacked tightly together. For a practical document, you should not insert too many margin figures consecutively and make the margin crowded.

You do not have to assign captions to figures. We show three figures with no captions below in the margin, in the main column, and in full width, respectively.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| fig-width: 3.5
#| fig-height: 2
#| column: margin
# a boxplot of weight vs transmission; this figure
# will be placed in the margin
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(am, wt)) + geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| warning: false
# a figure in the main column
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, hp)) + geom_point()
p
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
#| fig-width: 11
#| fig-height: 4
#| column: page-right
#| warning: false
# a fullwidth figure
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + facet_grid(~ gear)
